# HealthCare Internet Application

I have built a HealthCare Information Exchange System in Spring Framework. HIE allows doctors, nurses, pharmacists, healthcare providerd and patients to appropriately access and securely share patients vital medical information improving the speed, quality and safety of the patient.
Developed a robust drug safety management system enabling doctors to communicate with pharmaceutical companies about the patients drug experience and enforce drug callback in case of serious interactions.
I have designed an online forum that lets patients to write and view their experiences with doctors and drugs in their community.
